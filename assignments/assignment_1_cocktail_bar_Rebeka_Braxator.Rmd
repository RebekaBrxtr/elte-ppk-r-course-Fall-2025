# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

cocktails <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
glimpse(cocktails)
str(cocktails)
head(cocktails$ingredients)
```


## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cocktails_clean <- cocktails |>
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") |>      # split ingredients
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients)) |>  # remove extra spaces
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\d+[\\s/\\d]*\\s*(oz|ml|dash|tsp|cup|part|tblsp|teaspoon|drop|slice|sprig|%)?")) |>  # remove quantities
  mutate(ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\(.*?\\)")) |>   # remove parentheses
  filter(ingredients != "")
View(cocktails_clean)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredient_list <- cocktails_clean |>
  # Remove duplicate ingredients
  distinct(ingredients) |>
  # Organise in alphabetical order
  arrange(ingredients)

ingredient_list

View(ingredient_list)

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
n_unique_ingredients <- cocktails_clean |> 
  count(ingredients) |> 
  nrow()
str(n_unique_ingredients)
 
  
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top_ingredients <- cocktails_clean |>
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) |>
  slice_max(n, n = 10, with_ties = TRUE)

top_ingredients

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
most_ingredients <- cocktails_clean |>
  count(name) |>
  filter(n == max(n))

most_ingredients

View(most_ingredients)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktails_clean |>
  count(ingredients) |>
  filter(n == 1)
nrow(rare_ingredients)

rare_ingredients

View(rare_ingredients)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
one_cocktail_ingredients <- cocktails_clean |> 
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients)
one_cocktail_ingredients
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
no_rare_ingredients_cocktails <- cocktails_clean |> 
  filter(!ingredients %in% rare_ingredients$ingredients)

no_rare_ingredients_cocktails
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cheat_sheet <- cocktails_clean |> 
  mutate(has_it = "X") |> 
  select(name, ingredients, has_it) |> 
  distinct() |>
  tidyr::pivot_wider(
    names_from = ingredients, 
    values_from = has_it, 
    values_fill = ""
  )
View(cheat_sheet)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
